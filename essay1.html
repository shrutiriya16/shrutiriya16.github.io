  <h1>Guilt and Grace</h1>
  <p class="meta">An essay by Shruti Riya</p>
  <hr>

  <p>
    At 6:50 a.m., my alarm rang. I pressed snooze, promising myself five more minutes of peace.
    Fifteen minutes later, I was still in bed, half-awake, half-anxious. My friends often ask
    why I get up late even when I sleep on time; it's because I suffer from anxiety — at night,
    in a mild cold, it increases. But this is not the only problem; my heart races fast in the heat,
    making me anxious again.
  </p>

  <p>
    I hurried through a hot shower, did my skincare, and stretched a bright smile across my face —
    the kind that hides the random fear and anxiety inside. While heading to the dining hall for
    breakfast, I realized I'd spent too long picking the “perfect” outfit to lift my mood. The
    clock punished me again. Late.
  </p>

  <p>
    Guilt wrapped around me like a second skin: guilt for not being good enough, not being on time,
    not being happy. I feel these emotions often, daily, but with a broad smile, I went inside,
    took a piece of bread and jam in my mouth, and ran towards the lecture hall.
  </p>

  <p>
    I could see many students like me walking along my side, but strangely, no one talked to anyone;
    everyone was lost in their rush. A few laughed and joked, and I envied their ease. When someone
    tried to speak to me, I behaved awkwardly, with my mind buzzing with hundreds of unwanted thoughts.
  </p>

  <p>
    By the time I reached class, it was 8:05, and I knew I would have missed attendance. I took a
    breath and thought about whether to go to the class, and at last, after thinking for ten minutes,
    I decided not to go. My younger self — the one who dreamed of being fearless and brilliant — was
    still inside me, urging me to stay strong, fight against all odds, not miss any classes, and be
    at the top. But poor me had neither courage nor strength.
  </p>

  <p>
    With a heart full of guilt, as if I had murdered someone, I chose the longest route back to my
    hostel, trying to escape the loneliness waiting in that small room. But as I walked, the same
    campus looked different.
  </p>

  <p>
    The sounds of academic discussion and rushing footsteps faded into birds singing in melody.
    The rush of cycles driving was taken over by small squirrels running without paying attention
    to traffic signals in search of food or playing some game. A soft and cool breeze of leaves
    replaced the honking horns.
  </p>

  <p>
    The same breeze gave me a slight blow, making me shiver, but from inside, I didn’t feel cold;
    instead, it brought warmth with it. For the first time in days, I felt the air without fear.
    The serenity outside began to hush the noise inside.
  </p>

  <p>
    I sat on the damp grass with a lot of marigolds beside me. Tiny droplets of dew and the rays of
    the sun falling on them gave them a light golden appreciation, making them more precious than
    gold. The sun, penetrating through a light fog, also shone its radiance on me.
  </p>

  <p>
    I wasn’t gold at the moment, but I definitely became brass — with a bright shine on it.
    The tranquility of the marigolds brought back memories of the daffodil poem from old school,
    which spoke of finding peace in a field of flowers. Maybe Wordsworth had also felt this kind
    of quiet joy.
  </p>

  <p>
    I kept staring at the big trees and thought about how these non-locomotive living beings stayed
    away from their family, alone and broken. Then, a flash of my life came — leaving my family
    behind to go for higher studies.
  </p>

  <p>
    Fortunately, I went back during winter break to meet them, but the distance between our hearts
    had increased, just like the distance between us. A yellow leaf fell from the tree while I was
    lost in my thoughts.
  </p>

  <p>
    I wondered if the tree was hurt by losing one of its old components or if it was letting go of
    the past and allowing the beautiful, fresh, and new to emerge. It gave me a realization — to
    refresh myself, grow, and move on with time without worry.
  </p>

  <p>
    The fog lifted completely; the sky turned blue again. I felt warmth in that gentle light, which
    reminded me of the warmth of the first meal at my home. An hour passed, and students hurried
    past, but I didn’t feel anxious this time.
  </p>

  <p>
    I smiled — not to hide anything, but because I finally meant it.
  </p>

  <p>
    Walking back to my hostel, I noticed every small thing: dogs sleeping in the shade, old buildings
    standing proud, new ones shining bright, people hurrying to work. After a long time, I wasn’t
    rushing to catch up with anyone.
  </p>

  <p>
    I wasn’t counting what I’d missed. I was there — alive, breathing, part of something gentle and
    constant. Maybe peace was never waiting for me at the end of achievements or perfect mornings.
  </p>

  <p>
    Perhaps it had always been here — in the space between guilt and grace — in a quiet campus,
    a patch of marigolds, in the sound of my steady breath.
  </p>

  <p>
    I walked into the mess slowly and ate my breakfast without apology. My heart still beat fast,
    but it didn’t scare me anymore. It was just the sound of being alive.
