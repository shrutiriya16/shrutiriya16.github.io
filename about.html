  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <p>
  I am a student with a deep love for writing, shaped by my own experiences and observations.
  </p>

  <p>
  I write about ordinary days, inner struggles, small moments of calm, and the emotions we often carry silently.
  Writing helps me slow down, reflect, and make sense of what I feel.
